\title{Nominal Workbench -- Methodology}
\author{No-Work Dev. team}
\date\today

\begin{document}
\maketitle

In this document, we will describe the methodology that we apply for
the development of the project Nominal-Workbench. This description
will follow three main axis which are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Agile methodology
\item The tools used
\item The interactions with the client
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Agile methodology}

In this project, we chose to apply an agile methodology for an
efficient development. We had two options in mind, which were Scrum or
Extreme Programming.

We finally decided to choose the Scrum methodology for many reasons:
first of all, the development in Scrum can be done by each developer
independantly. In Extreme Programming, dev team has to be in a single
room and sometimes has to work by pair of developers. More and over,
the interaction with the client is simpler with Scrum. The client has
to talk only with the customer relations manager to follow the
evolution of the project while, in Extreme Programming, he has to
interact with every developer to stay aware.

Meetings take place weekly in order to answer those three questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What have I done ?
\item What is my next work ?
\item What difficulties have been encountered ?
\end{itemize}

We had to adapt the Scrum methodology to match with our schedule and
our disponibility. Therefore, we defined the Sprints duration to be of
one week instead of a month.

\chapter{Tools}

All along this project, we will use some tools to improve our
efficiency.

\section{Rallydev}

Rallydev is a Scrum platform on which we can add, describe and edit
user stories. We can also assign a developper with a task and see the
progression of the development. A task can be either defined, in
progress, completed or accepted.
