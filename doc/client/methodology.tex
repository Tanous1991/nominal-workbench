\section{Overview}

In this document, we will describe the methodology that we apply for
the development of the project Nominal-Workbench. This description
will follow three main axis which are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Agile methodology
\item The tools used
\item The interactions with the client
\end{itemize}

\section{Agile methodology}

In this project, we chose to apply an agile methodology for an
efficient development. We had two options in mind, which were Scrum or
Extreme Programming.

We finally decided to choose the Scrum methodology for many reasons:
first of all, the development in Scrum can be done by each developer
independantly. In Extreme Programming, dev team has to be in a single
room and sometimes has to work by pair of developers. More and over,
the interaction with the client is simpler with Scrum. The client has
to talk mainly with the customer relations manager to follow the
evolution of the project while, in Extreme Programming, he has to
interact with every developer to stay aware.

Meetings take place weekly in order to answer those three questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What have I done ?
\item What is my next work ?
\item What difficulties have been encountered ?
\end{itemize}

We had to adapt the Scrum methodology to match with our schedule and
our disponibility. Therefore, we defined the Sprints duration to be of
one week instead of a month.

\section{Tools}

All along this project, we will use some tools to improve our
efficiency.

\subsection{Rallydev}

Rallydev is a Scrum platform on which we can add, describe and edit
user stories. We can also assign a developer with a task and see the
progression of the development. A ``story'' can be either defined, in
progress, completed or accepted.

\subsection{Git}

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management
system. We decided to use the web-based hosting service : GitHub. This
choice was motivated by the fact that both the client and the
development team were already familiar with this kind of repository
system.

GitHub also provides the possibility to create wikis and to easily
report issues thus enhancing the communication between the team members.

The project repository is forked from the client's one and will be
asked to be pulled upstream after each ``sprint'' iteration.

\subsection{Building system}

There were several building systems we could use. We decided that
classical Makefile would not suffice as the scalability was difficult
to maintain as the project would grow. After consideration, we finally
decided to use \emph{ocp-build} which allows the project to be
well-organized, to spend less time resolving dependencies issues and
to have an easy way for everyone to include the new tests and
libraries without a deep knowledge about the building system.

\section{Client interactions}

Once every two weeks, or on demand, the client will be able to discuss
with some of the team members. During these meetings, a full report of
the advancement will be presented to the client. Afterwards, the
client reacts if any concern is raised about the work achieved.

If necessary, there will be also a discussion about development
issues. It may be about technological choices or implementation
decisions.

We will conclude the meeting with an overview of the future work that
will be done until the next one. The client will then be able to
request any new features he'd like to add into the project.

If there is an urging matter between two meeting, such as a bug
related issue or an important feature to quickly add then the project
manager will adapt the current sprint and include the new stories with
a suitable priority. Such an event may be signaled either by a mail
or directly on GitHub depending on the client preferences.
